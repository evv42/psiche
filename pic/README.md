This folder contains the program that will run the emulated CPU on the PIC16F54.  

Each xx.fuses.conf file contains a configuration for a different oscillator type. Please refer to the PIC16F54 datasheet for more details on that.  

An assembled out.hex file is included. If you want to assemble from the source, you'll need gputils to run the build.sh script.
