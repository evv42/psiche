This folder contains the assembler for the psiche processor.  

It is based on [asm6502](https://github.com/boeckmann/asm6502/), with minimal modifications.  

The build.sh script should work in most situations. If not, refer to your C compiler documentation.  

### TODO

As of now, the immediate 16-bit load instructions (LDB, LDD) do not use the '#' prefix.
